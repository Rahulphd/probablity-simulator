        Subjective probability is based on personal judgment, belief, or knowledge.

        Imagine you're trying to diagnose a rare disease that affects 1% of the population. 
        You have a test that is 99% accurate. If a person has the disease, the test will 
        correctly identify it 99% of the time. If a person doesn't have the disease, the 
        test will correctly show a negative result 99% of the time. However, the test will 
        show a false positive 1% of the time. If a person takes the test and gets a positive 
        result, what's the probability they actually have the disease?
